I checked Zac senpai's starter code and got some ideas about what's going on.
My current solution to this problem is to use IDA* and with a limit depth to search from.
By using minimax, alpha-beta pruning and a limited depth, the program can run faster.

The heuristic function will be measuring 'most wins' and the cost is always one for all moves.

print('Hello World')

init, start(), second_move(), third_move(),
last_move(), win(), loss(), draw(), end()
