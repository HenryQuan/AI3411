I checked Zac senpai's starter code and got some ideas about what's going on.
My current solution to use minimax and alpha-beta pruning. Gradually increas ethe depth when the game is closer to an end.

The heuristic function will be measuring 'most wins' and the cost is always one for all moves.

print('Hello World')

init, start(), second_move(), third_move(),
last_move(), win(), loss(), draw(), end()
