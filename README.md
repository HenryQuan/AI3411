# AI 3411
Assignments of COMP3411 19T1.
## Assignments
### Assignment 1 - Prolog
Q4 was really challenging and I got 10.1/12 for this assignment.

### Assignment 2 - Written (searching algorithm, alpha-beta pruning)
Nah, I am not really good with this kind of assignment. (8.5/12)

### [Assignment 3 - Nine-Board Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AI3411/tree/master/Assignment%203)
Using minimax with alpha-beta pruning to write a program that can play better than you do (hopefully). (13.3/16)

## Afterthought
My implementation has major performance issues (many unneccessary copies). It can win against average human but against AI, it is quite week. It does win sometimes but usually, it needs to search way deeper than its opponent. If I have more time, I will improve this and probably make a [game](https://github.com/HenryQuan/TicTacToe-Ultimate) with flutter. I got credit (65%) for this course and I am top 77% among all my mates. My theory knowledge is quite weak and I got 33.3/60 in the final. I would have got at least 10% more but I think what's more important is programming. To remember everything is just a matter of time but if you don't understand, you cannot program. This course is a good course and I recommend it.
